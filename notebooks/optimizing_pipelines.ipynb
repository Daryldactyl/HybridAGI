    "### Why do we need optimization, and why this is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people implementing Agent frameworks think that by relying on the \"best\" LMs of the market is enough, give it the right prompt and it will understand right? right?\n",
    "\n",
    "LMs needs, at the current state of the art, for each concept an exponential number of examples in the training set to have a linear gain in understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means in practice? It means that the current thinking that scaling will solve everything is **wrong**. Exponential examples, means not only that the dataset to train needs to grow exponentially, but *also* that the size of the models needs to grow exponentialy to recall efficiently all that data. As the cost of inference is rising and start-ups starting to fall, people will realize that bigger is not better. Relying on scaling alone with an architecture that doesn't scale is not the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "By giving to the LMs examples of input/outputs in the context, we can enhance the results, no matter how well you explain your task in your prompt, having examples will always help the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more out of distribution your task is, the more you need to give it examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt engineering technique is called Few Shot inferences and is one of the most powerfull/simple way to enhance the atomic steps of your pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic generation and selection of examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In DSPy, the process to automatically generate and select the examples at inference time is called bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is crucial because hand-writing these examples is time-consuming and not adaptable to changes in the prompt/pipeline. Each time you modify your pipeline, you will need to re-write these examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "HybridAGI stand above any other Agent framework that doesn't provide a way to generate, evaluate and select automatically these examples.\n",
    "Now that we have our pipeline set up, and know why we need to optimize it, we are going to select some nice examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling infinite loops\n",
    "\n",
    "One could argue that HybridAGI is sensible to infinite loops, as we use the LMs to evaluate conditional loops.\n",
    "But before diving into this aspect, let's understand why this can happen. In HybridAGI because we guide the reasoning process of the agent, an infinite loop means that an error occured during the evaluation of a decision by the Agent. To make perfect decisions, we need to populate the LMs context with the right data first, so you need to make sure that your pipeline is correct and use enough intermediate steps if your task is difficult, like adding a critique stage defore evaluating the correctness of an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can enhance the decision process by providing examples like explained above, but we also need to discard during optimization the examples if they introduced an infinite loop (meaning they introduced errors). This behavior is made possible by testing if the agent exeeded the maximum iterations in the metric and return `False` or `0.0`. This condition is handled in every metric we provide."
