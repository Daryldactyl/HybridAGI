    "# First Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will guide you through the basic concepts and features of HybridAGI, a neuro-symbolic agent system that allows you to program its behavior using a graph-based prompt programming approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "HybridAGI is designed for data scientists, prompt engineers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts who love to experiment with AI. It is a \"Build Yourself\" product that focuses on human creativity rather than AI autonomy. With HybridAGI, you can create AI agents that behave as expected and efficiently use any tool while controlling their long-term behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduction to HybridAGI and its key features\n",
    "- Installation and setup of HybridAGI using virtualenv and Docker\n",
    "- Overview of the Domain Specific Language (DSL) of HybridAGI and its basic syntax\n",
    "- Examples of graph-based prompt programming using the DSL\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have an understanding of the basic concepts of HybridAGI and be able to start experimenting with it on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up the Knowledge Base locally\n",
    "\n",
    "HybridAGI works with a low-latency hybrid vector/graph database called [FalkorDB](https://www.falkordb.com/). This knowledge base should be started when you work with HybridAGI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the database using docker with the following command in you terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 6379:6379 -it --rm falkordb/falkordb:edge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up Ollama to test your pipelines locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your pipelines locally, we need to setup Ollama to run the LLMs in a separate server. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux:\n",
    "Open a terminal and use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install it on linux\n",
    "curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n",
    "# Then launch the Ollama server with\n",
    "ollama pull mistral\n",
    "ollama serve\n",

    "\n",
    "### Windows:\n",

    "HybridAGI is an agent system that introduces a `GraphProgramInterpreter`. Similar to how the Python interpreter executes a program line by line, HybridAGI's interpreter executes a graph program node by node. To store these graph programs, we use a hybrid vector/graph database called `ProgramMemory`. This memory is the sole required memory of the system and is responsible for storing Cypher Prompt Programs, such as the following example:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the provided example, we have a simple graph program consisting of three nodes: `start`, `end`, and `answer`. The `start` and `end` nodes are control nodes that denote the beginning and end of the program, respectively. The `answer` node is an action node that uses the `Speak` tool to answer the objective's question.\n",
