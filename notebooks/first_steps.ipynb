    "# First Steps with HybridAGI\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will guide you through the basic concepts and features of HybridAGI, a neuro-symbolic agent system that allows you to program its behavior using a graph-based prompt programming approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduction to HybridAGI Graph Prompt Programming\n",
    "- Installation and setup of HybridAGI\n",
    "- Overview of the Domain Specific Language (DSL) of HybridAGI and its basic syntax\n",
    "- Examples of graph-based prompt programming using the DSL\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have an understanding of the basic concepts of HybridAGI and be able to start experimenting with it on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up the Knowledge Base locally\n",
    "\n",
    "HybridAGI works with a low-latency hybrid vector/graph database called [FalkorDB](https://www.falkordb.com/). This knowledge base should be started when you work with HybridAGI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the database using docker with the following command in you terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 3000:3000 -it --rm falkordb/falkordb:edge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up Ollama to test your pipelines locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your pipelines locally, we need to setup Ollama to run the LLMs in a separate server. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux:\n",
    "Open a terminal and use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install it on linux\n",
    "curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n",
    "# Then launch the Ollama server with\n",
    "ollama pull mistral\n",
    "ollama serve\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows:\n",
    "Downloads the Ollama executable [here](https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe)"

    "\n",
    "HybridAGI is an agent system that introduces a `GraphProgramInterpreter`. Similar to how the Python interpreter executes a program line by line, HybridAGI's interpreter executes a graph program node by node. To store these graph programs, we use a hybrid vector/graph database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a dependency tree is automatically generated when loading the programs. This dependency tree enables the system to protect the main prompting mechanism and its dependencies, as well as allowing similarity-based search over the Agent's graph programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we have a simple graph program consisting of three nodes: `start`, `end`, and `answer`. The `start` and `end` nodes are control nodes that denote the beginning and end of the program, respectively. The `answer` node is an action node that uses the `Speak` tool to answer the objective's question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The edges between the nodes are defined using the `-[:NEXT]->` syntax, which indicates that the interpreter should move to the next node in the program. In this case, the interpreter will start at the `start` node, move to the `answer` node, and then finally move to the `end` node."
